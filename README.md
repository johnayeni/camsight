# Android YOLO with TensorFlow Mobile
This android application uses YOLOv2 model for object detection. It uses tensorflow mobile to run neural networks. I would like to use tensorflow lite later. Probably, it is the first open source implementation of the second version of YOLO for Tensorflow on Android device. The demo application detects 20 classes of Pascal VOC dataset. Please read this paper for more information about the YOLOv2 model: [YOLO9000 Better, Faster, Stronger](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf).

**Steps to compile and run the application:**

Prerequirements:

* Install the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html);
* Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher is required to run the demo application due to usage of Camera2 API;

Compile and run the project:

* Clone this repository;
* Import your project into the Android Studio;/Config.java) file;
* Run the project from Android Studio;
